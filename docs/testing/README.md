## Overview

The SmartEdu platform follows a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure code quality and reliability. This folder contains documentation for the testing strategy, unit testing, and integration testing.

## Key Concepts

- **Testing Pyramid**: The testing strategy follows the testing pyramid approach, with a focus on unit tests.
- **Unit Tests**: Tests that focus on individual components, functions, and modules.
- **Integration Tests**: Tests that focus on the interaction between different parts of the application.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Tests that simulate user interactions with the application.

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: For test running and assertions
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: For mocking API requests
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing

## Best Practices

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing features.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical functionality.
- **Mocking**: Use mocks to isolate the code being tested.
- **Continuous Integration**: Run tests automatically on every pull request.
