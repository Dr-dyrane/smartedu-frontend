## üöÄ 1TechAcademy Platform: User Flow & Feature Specification

**Version:** [Date of generation]

**Overview:** This document outlines the user experience, core features, and administrative capabilities of the 1TechAcademy platform, designed for students, teachers, and administrators.

---

### üåç **1. Public Access & Initial Entry**

*   **Landing Page (`/`)**:
    *   Presents the platform's value proposition, possibly featuring courses.
    *   Provides clear navigation to "Sign In" and "Sign Up".
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ Done.

---

### üîê **2. Authentication & Profile Completion**

*   **Standard Authentication**:
    *   **Sign Up (`/register`):** User registers with email and password. Email verification step included.
    *   **Sign In (`/login`):** User logs in with credentials.
    *   **Password Reset (`/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`):** Standard forgot/reset password flow via email.
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented (Core logic, UI).
*   **Post-Authentication Routing & Onboarding**:
    *   Upon successful login/signup, the system checks the user's profile (`profileComplete` flag) and the `skipOnboarding` flag (from Redux state).
    *   **If `profileComplete === false` AND `skipOnboarding === false`**: The user is **redirected** to the `/profile` page to complete necessary information. **There is no separate `/onboarding` page.**
    *   **Otherwise**: The user is redirected to their role-specific dashboard (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/admin/dashboard`).
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented (Redirection logic, profile check concept).
*   **Profile Page (`/profile`)**:
    *   **Dual Purpose:** Serves as both the **onboarding completion form** and the **standard profile update page**.
    *   **Context Detection:** The page uses an `isOnboarding` state (derived from `profileComplete` and `skipOnboarding`) to adapt its UI, requirements, and submission logic.
    *   **UI Components:** Utilizes modular components: `ProfileAlerts`, `ProfileAvatarInfo`, `ProfileFormFields`, and the enhanced `DatePickerWithYearMonth` for date selection.
    *   **Student Onboarding Flow:**
        *   Required fields: Full Name, Date of Birth, Primary Class/Course selection, Account Type (Individual/Corporate).
        *   Optional role-specific fields (e.g., bio for teacher) may appear but aren't mandatory for initial completion.
        *   **Course Selection:** Defaults intelligently based on cart items (if any) or previously selected/only available course.
        *   **Skip Option:** Allows users to skip onboarding (sets flag, redirects to dashboard). Profile remains incomplete.
    *   **Corporate Manager Onboarding Flow (Conceptual - UI TODO in `/profile`):**
        *   *TODO:* A toggle "Registering for a company?" appears on the `/profile` page during onboarding.
        *   *TODO:* If Yes: Fields for Company Name, Number of Students appear. Course selection becomes multi-select.
        *   *TODO:* "Generate Student Slots" button appears, triggering an API call to create placeholder student accounts linked by `corporateId`.
    *   **Profile Update Flow:** Allows users to update mutable fields (Name, DoB, optional fields) after onboarding. Email/Role are typically read-only.
    *   **Submission & Redirection (Onboarding):**
        *   Updates user profile via API/thunk.
        *   Marks profile as complete (via API/thunk setting `profileComplete=true`).
        *   Clears/sets the `skipOnboarding` flag as appropriate.
        *   **If cart has items:** Redirects to `/pricing` (or `/checkout`) with account type.
        *   **If cart is empty:** Redirects to the user's dashboard.
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented (Student path structure, modular components, skip logic, basic submission). ‚è≥ Corporate flow UI on this page is TODO.

---

### üè† **3. Role-Based Dashboards**

*   **Entry Point:** The primary landing area after successful login and profile completion.
*   **Content:** Each role (`student`, `teacher`, `admin`) sees a tailored dashboard displaying relevant summaries, key metrics, quick actions, and navigation.
*   **Status:** ‚è≥ Conceptual (Specific content and layout for each role's dashboard needs implementation).
